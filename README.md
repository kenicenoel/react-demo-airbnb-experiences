# Airbnb Experience Clone

    I created this React demo to try out using TypeScript with React. I used
    TypeScript with Angular and have since fallen in love with it because it makes
    JavaScript palletable to me as a C# developer.

    In this demo, components and props are used to design the layout

## Why TypeScript?

    TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) is awesome. 
    It allows JavaScript to become strongly typed by adding support for types, interfaces and
    other awesome goodies that JavaScript does not have built-in. 
    TypeScript also makes it possible to fix errors because it can highlight various errors before compile time.

## What now?

    Download this demo, do an `npm install` and then `npm start` from your terminal of choice.
